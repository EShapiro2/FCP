Assignment No. 4	Due Monday, December, 22
     
This is a programming assignment.  It should be handed in
together with a script of its execution.
     
     
(1) Sieve of Eratosthenes: The program shown in handout no. 4
 	uses division, whereas the standard sequential implementation
	(in Fortran, say) would use only addition.  Modify the
	program shown in the handout to use only addition.
	Hint: adding one argument to `filter' is enough.
     
(2) Merge sort:
    Define  	
	msort(ListOfXs,Ys) :-
	ListOfXs is a list of sorted lists (initially singleton
	lists), and Ys is the sorted list of their elements.
	Use a variant of opmerge (handout no. 5) to merge the sorted
	(sub)lists.
     
	E.g. msort([[2],[4],[3]],[2,3,4]).
     
(3) Matrix multiplication: modify the program shown in handout no. 5
	to pipeline both matrices between the inner-product processes.
	Hint: define an inner product process with five arguments:
	two input streams, two output streams, and a result.

	(You may wish to wait until after the class discussion of
	matrix multiply and pipelines before attempting this one.)
