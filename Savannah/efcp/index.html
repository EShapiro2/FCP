It is a process oriented language, whichembodies dataflow synchronization and guarded command indeterminacy as the basic controlmechanisms. Flat Concurrent Prolog (FCP) <a href="references.html#[3]">[3]</a>, was identified asa practical and efficient subset of Concurrent Prolog, which supports most of its programmingtechniques. The reader is referred to <a href="references.html#[6]">[6]</a> for a survey of thelanguage and its programming techniques, and for an extensive bibliography.Further evolution of the language resulted in the development of FCP(:,?),which is the language currently supported by the Logix System. The reader isreferred to <a href="references#[10]">[10]</a> for language definition, and to<a href="references.html#[11]">[11]</a> for program examples and techniques.</p><p>Logix is a programming environment written in Flat Concurrent Prolog (FCP) whichallows the development and testing of concurrent logic programs. Logix includesa compiler, which compiles FCP programs into an FCP abstract machine instructionset, and an emulator, written in C, which emulates these instructions. Logix isorganized around three types of objects: computations, modules, and services. Acomputation is the unit of execution, control and debugging in Logix; a moduleis the unit of compilation; a service provides access to facilities andcapabilities of the underlying system, for example the screen and the fileservices. Several computations may proceed in parallel under Logix. A computationmay span many modules and services; several concurrent computations may execute code in thesame module.</p><p>A computation occurs in time. It starts with an initial process, typicallyspecified interactively by the user. At each point in time a computationconsists of a multiset of processes; it terminates when this becomes empty. Acomputation proceeds by processes performing actions. A process may terminate,fork, or change state. While doing so it may assign values to variables byunification, thus achieving the effect of communication in general, and outputconstruction in particular. On a multiprocessor Logix, a computation could spanseveral processors.</p> <p>A module is a unit of compilation. It consists of a set of procedures, precededby an optional declaration. A procedure may call and be called by procedures inother modules using remote procedure calls. Modules are loaded automaticallywhen called and compiled automatically as needed. The active module is aservice, which may be either a server or a monitor.  Remote procedure callsbetween services are implemented via the stream communication capabilities ofFCP. In a parallel implementation of Logix different services may reside indifferent processors, and remote procedure calls may cross processor boundaries<a href="references.html#[7">[7]</a>.</p> <p>A Logix user is provided with an initial set of services, which are accessed viaremote procedure calls. These include a screen service, a file service, and a compile service, among others. In addition, a server or monitor is created foreach service, to serve remote procedure calls directed to it.</p> <p><a href="acquire.html" name="Acquire Logix">Acquiring the Logix system</a></p><p><a href="Logix/index.html">More about the Logix system</a></p><p><a href="SpiFcp/index.html">The SpiFcp subsystem</a></p><p><a href="SpiFcp/BioSpi/index.html">The BioSpi subsystem</a></p><p><a href="Updates/index.html">Incremental updates per release</a></p><br><br><p>This document is licensed under: <a href="gnu-gpl3.html" name="License">Gnu General Public License - Version 3</a></p></body></html>
